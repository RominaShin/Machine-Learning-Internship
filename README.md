# Machine-Learning-Internship
<br>
<h3>This internship program at rahnema college is going to be a 2 months process in which we'll get fundamentals in machine learning and finally release a project with supervision of rahnema's former interns.</h3>

<br>

As a final project, I've developed a system to detect crawlers and intrusion with an unsupervised approach to anomaly detection.
This project was based on Sanjagh's server access log.
<br>

The main steps toward developing this system is mentioned bellow:
<br>
•Processing raw log file
<br>

•Feature engineering
<br>

•Building an Anomaly Model
<br>

•Developing an API
<br>
